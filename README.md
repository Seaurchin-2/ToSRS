# ToSRS : Theory of Special Relativity Simulator

---

It shows how the theory of special relativity works in Inertial coordinate system.  
Most of situation in simulator are realized from previous questions of **South Korea High School Physics I**:  
```
 Relative speed
 Relativity principle
 Principle of Constancy of Light Velocity
 Relativity of simultaneity
 Time dilation
 Length contraction
```

Key Components are:
* **Space ship which moves at a speed close to light**  
* **One or more light sources (not implemented)**  
* **One or more light from light sources (not implemented)**
* **A stationary observer (not implemented)**
